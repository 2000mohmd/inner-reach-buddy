 * End-to-end tests. These run against the app served by the Vite dev server on
 * :8080 (the production build uses the cloudflare-module Nitro preset, which
 * needs `wrangler dev` rather than `vite preview` — not worth the extra moving
 * part for a smoke suite). The vitest suite (`npm test`) covers unit/contract
 * logic; this covers the actual rendered app + the HTTP API surface.
 *
 * Playwright is installed on-demand (not in package.json — bun.lock is the
 * tracked lockfile). To run: `npm run test:e2e`. First run downloads Chromium.
 * If a dev server is already up on :8080 it is reused.
